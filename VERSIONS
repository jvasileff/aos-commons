        - Change startPrefixMapping and endPrefixMapping contract to call these
          methods _after_ getProcessorFor() is called, and to call the mapping
          functions on the _new_ processor that was returned by
          getProcessorFor.

          This makes more sense since the prefixMapping calls really apply to
          the new element, not the parent of the element that recieves the
          mappings.

        - COMPATIBILITY NOTE: this breaks compatibility for code that
          implements ElementProcessor.startPrefixMapping() or
          ElementProcessor.endPrefixMapping().
        
        - COMPATIBILITY NOTE: this breaks compatibility for code in which
          ElementProcessor.getProcessorFor() relies on the prefix included in
          qName to have been mapped by prior calls to startPrefixMapping().
          The new contract does not call startPrefixMapping() until after
          getProcessorFor() is called.
