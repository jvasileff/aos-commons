/**
 *  <code>URIHandler</code> subclasses resolve <code>URI</code>s of a specific
 *  type to <code>URL</code>s.  <b>A URIHandler instance should not be used to
 *  indiscriminantly resolve URIs</b>, but should rather be used only after a
 *  URI has been determined to be suitable for the particular URIHandler
 *  instance.  Applications should register URIHandler instances with a
 *  URIHelper instance and the URIHelper should be used to resolve URIs.
 *  <p>
 *  A particular subclass implementation should not be bound to a specific
 *  protocol - in other words, a subclasses should resolve URIs based on host,
 *  port, path, or any other parameters provided by the URI object except
 *  protocol.  This is necessary in order to allow an application to provide a
 *  custom mapping between application specific protocol names and instances of
 *  URIHandler subclasses.
 *  </p><p>
 *  Example:  An application may need to associate a protocol named "classpath"
 *  with a URIHandler that uses URLs returned from the system classloader's
 *  getResource() method.  Another application may wish to do the same, but
 *  with a different protocol name.
 *  </p><p>
 *  A more advanced usage may involve an application using two instances of the
 *  same URIHandler subclass with different configuration settings and protocol
 *  names.  For example, two protocol names could be used with each referring
 *  to a different classloader.  A URIHelper would be used to determine which
 *  URIHandler instance to use based on the URI's protocol.
 *  </p>
